### Hi there 👋
I'm a self taught developer who is still in high school. 

I love automation (only for boring work), APIs, bots and physical simulations. (*^_^*)

I primarily code in Python and Julia, but I'm learning a bit of HTML/CSS and Browser side JavaScript for small projects and I have worked with Unity C#, Visual Basic, and some Android Development before.

I'd love to learn stuff closer to the metal like C/C++ and a few other languages, but I'm just working on some interesting smaller projects for now, and I'm *really* busy with school. ￣へ￣

As you can tell, I really like newlines, 4 spaced indentation, and Unicode. ヾ(⌐■_■)ノ♪

I prefer the pronouns: "He, Him, His, His, Himself", But some also call me "The great lord and saviour". (⊙_⊙;)

I'm sorry, this is genuinely the most cringy repo I have on my GitHub.
